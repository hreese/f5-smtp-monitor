# F5-SMTP-Monitor

The builtin smtp liveness check on BIG-IP F5 has two problems:

1. it only checks if the SMTP server responds to connections and HELO/EHLO
2. It contains a [bug](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K99840695) that makes exim send
   a TCP RST resulting on backend being marked as down. This is fixed in newer releases.

This test also detects breakage in later stages like behavior checks (spam detection) and
content checks (for example antivirus) by sending a test email.

Check the buildin help for up-to-date information on switches and usage:

```sh
$ f5-smtp-monitor --help
This smtp backend check expects two mandatory arguments:

1. ip address (IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses for IPv4, e.g. "":ffff:a.b.c.d")
2. tcp port number

The rest of the program is controlled by environment variables (defaults in parenthesis):

* DEBUG:     when set to anything than 0 enables debugging output to syslog (0)
* SENDER:    mail sender (sender@example.com)
* RECIPIENT: mail recipient (recipient@example.com)
* SUBJECT:   mail subject ("F5 Loadbalancer Keepalive Test")
* BODY:      mail body ("")
* STARTTLS:  try STARTTLS without certificate verification when set (NOT SET)
* HELO:      use value for HELO/EHLO (localhost)
* TESTAV:    add EICAR test virus to body when set (NOT SET)
* TESTSPAM:  add GTUBE spam string to body when set (NOT SET)
```

# Prebuilt binaries

Autogenerated binaries are available on the [project's release page on github](https://github.com/hreese/f5-smtp-monitor/releases).

## How to build

Install [Go](https://golang.org) on your build machine.

```sh
go get -v github.com/hreese/f5-smtp-monitor
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hreese/f5-smtp-monitor
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags "-s -w"
```

# Setting up the monitor on BIG-IP F5

TBDâ€¦

# Setting up your MTA

For performance reasons, the recommended way is having a special mailaddress or domain that discards everything.
We'll use `blackhole.example.com` here.

## exim

Add a rcpt-acl to always allow your discard domain:

```
accept
  domains = blackhole.example.com
  endpass
```

Add a discard router:

```
blackhole:
  driver  = redirect
  domains = blackhole.example.com
  data    = :blackhole:
```

Add your loadbalancer interfaces to `smtp_reserve_hosts` to make sure your backend tests succeed even under heavy load.
